### Building .hex file prerequisites:



~~1) Install Bash Shell on Windows, follow [this guide](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)~~ **Out-Dated, MSYS2 is now recommended**

1) Install MSYS2, following [this guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/install-build-tools)
> * Scroll down for how to install MSYS if you are on Windows


2) **Clone with Git or Download the QMK Zip and unzip it** 

https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware 
> * For this guide I’m going to make it easy and just download the Zip

3) **Extract the zip** so you have a folder named **QMK or qmk_firmware_master**
> * Place this in a nice easy location, that doesn’t require administrator access, like your documents folder or desktop

4) **Open a MSYS2 window** through the start menu (should be called "MSYS2 MSYS2" on Ubuntu on Windows)

5) **Change the directory to your QMK copy**, which you just unzipped.

* Do this using the `cd` command (Hard drives are accessed in MSYS2 by typing `cd /<driveletter>`)

Example `cd /c/Users/Nick/Documents/qmk_firmware_master`

6) Run **util/qmk_install.sh`**, This will run `apt-get upgrade`

7) Accept default repositories and wait a while (5 minutes for me), and then you are good to go

### Flashing .hex prerequisites:

1) Download Arduino drivers through the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

2) Download and install **AVRDudess**, [link here](http://blog.zakkemble.co.uk/avrdudess-a-gui-for-avrdude/)

3) Download and install **WinAVR or LIBUSB** to get the `LIBUSB0.DLL`
> * If you don’t then attempting to flash the pro micro won’t do anything     
> * I’m going to be using [WinAVR](http://winavr.sourceforge.net/index.html) for this, so download and install it

4) Go to install location of WinAVR and go to to the following path, using mine as an example 

**`C:\Program Files (x86)\WinAVR\utils\libusb\bin`**

5) Copy the **4 `libusb0` files** from the WinAVR folder into the AVRDUDESS Program Files location and it should look like this now.
**NOTICE** If these files already exist, then it is unecessary to copy them.
